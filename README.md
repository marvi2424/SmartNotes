# SmartNotes
Smartnotes is a web application where users can write and store notes. It was built using Python/Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
## How it works
Users must first create an account or log in. Then they are redirected to a page where all notes are listed. They can:
- View Notes
- Create New Notes
- Update Notes
- Delete Notes
